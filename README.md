# NS-INFO static site
To improve the performance of [NS-INFO](https://aaraar.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-1920) I created a static site generator.   
Unfortunately the core functionality is somewhat out of the scope I proposed for this project, so it kind of spiraled into something different

## To Do üìå
- [x] Set up build tools and deployment pipeline (custom webpack config and personal site generator)
- [X] Added environment modes for production and development (for workflow and ratelimit purposes)
- [x] Statically generate homepage
- [x] Statically generate station page
- [x] Deployed to now.sh
- [x] Added serverless functions to request arrivals and departures (not rendered yet, but active in the console)
- [x] Added static image of each station's location
- [ ] Add more detailed information to each station
- [ ] Progressive Enhance map to be interactive with javascript
- [ ] PE station to add arrivals and departures
- [ ] Create Trips page
- [ ] Create Trip page

## Change of direction
At first I tried to do the app SSR, I did not feel like I was doing anything new or worthwhile though, so I decided to take
a leap and try my hand at generating the site to static HTML files with Node.
I had to start over because of this decision, but the performance benefits up to this point are huge and it's actually really fun to do.

## Description üìù
For the biggest part it's a tech demo I created for testing with static generated content.
It contains a lot of trainstations in The Netherlands and neighbouring countries, but the content is mostly only available for
the dutch stations. It contains pictures and descriptions of it's facilities and some facilities show their availability. (like parking garages)

Check out the dutch stations in particular, since more data is available to those

```

- Add the following values to the .env file
    PORT=*Port that the server will be opened on*
    API_KEY_STATIONS=*NS API key with a subscription to 'ns-app*
    API_KEY_TRIPS=*NS API key with a extra subscription rights*
    MAPBOX_TOKEN=*Mapbox api key*
    NODE_ENV=*build mode (optional, will be development on local and production on most deployment services)*

- Set up project on now.sh

- run `now dev`

### Packages and Technologies
This project makes use of the following tech:

  * Webpack
  * Pug
  * SASS
  * ES6/7 JS

## API üêí
I made use of the following API for this project:

  * NS Places API
  * NS tripplanner (STATIONS) API

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Core features of this project.

  * JSON files are generated from the NS API's
  * Images are generated from the mapbox API
  * HTML Files are generated using the aforementioned JSON files and the PUG rendering engine

## Feedback ‚ö†Ô∏èüí¨
- Content on the stations page
- Progressive enhanced features for the service worker (what to add?)
- What functionality can I add, I'm a little stuck
