# NS-INFO static site
To improve the performance of [NS-INFO](https://aaraar.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-1920) I created a static site generator for the application.

- [x] Set up build tools and deployment pipeline (custom webpack config and personal site generator)
- [X] Added environment modes for production and development (for workflow and ratelimit purposes)
- [x] Statically generate homepage
- [x] Statically generate station page
- [x] Deployed to now.sh
- [x] Added serverless functions to request arrivals and departures (not rendered yet, but active in the console)
- [x] Added static image of each station's location
- [ ] Add more detailed information to each station
- [ ] Progressive Enhance map to be interactive with javascript
- [ ] PE station to add arrivals and departures
- [ ] Create Trips page
- [ ] Create Trip page

## What I tried
At first I tried to do the app SSR, I did not feel like I was doing anything new or worthwhile though, so I decided to take
a leap and try my hand at generating the site to static HTML files with Node.
I had to start over because of this decision, but the performance benefits up to this point are huge and it's actually really fun to do.
